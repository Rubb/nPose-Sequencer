# nPose-Sequencer
Requires:
* nPose V3

When it is desirable to run a sequence of notecards and set the extent of time each will run before starting the next, this plugin
is needed.

A few specific changes were made in the code to work with the new V3 version of nPose as the sequencer would no longer work.
